bio:
  - Hi, my name is Andrew Dunai. I'm from Lviv, Ukraine. In Ukrainian my name is pronounced as "Андрій Дунай." I speak English, Ukrainian, po polsku und auch nur ein bischen Deutsch.
  - So, here's my story!
  - I'm 25. I graduated from Lviv Polytechnic National University where I studied "Computer Systems and Networks".
  - My career started 13 years ago when I was 12 years old, and my first programming experience was writing apps in Basic, Pascal and PHP.
  - I did a lot of various tasks at freelancer.com (which was called getafreelancer.com at that moment.) using Wordpress, PHPBB, VBulletin, Drupal and frameworks like CakePHP & Codeigniter.
  - 'At 17 I worked for a Ukrainian ISP. I developed a social network for them. That was the peak of my popularity at that time: nearly 30,000 people were using it. I felt myself like a young Zuckerberg. The project was still alive until 2016 when it was shutdown - almost 8 years after I left the company.'
  - Currently I'm working as a Software Architect at Newfire Partners - a company from US with HQ in Boston & Lviv, Ukraine. I'm focused on building distributed scalable systems. I mostly write in Python, NodeJS and Java. My current project is built on the top of RabbitMQ, Consul service discovery & AWS + Docker as deployment platform.
  - 'Although Python is still my primary direction, I typically choose the stack of technologies based on the requirements of the project. I believe there is no such thing as "bad technology": every instrument is built to serve a specific job. I know Python from alpha to omega, but I also have equally strong background in Java, C, and JavaScript.'
  - I love thrash metal, stoner rock & synthwave music. I also like traveling, snowboarding and playing with IoT.
  - I love to travel! I've been to US (in particular New York - thanks to the IBM company who invited me to visit their mainframe center in Poughkeepsie, I've also been to Washington, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Arizona, Baltimore, Kentucky), and in Europe I visited France, Netherlands, Sweden, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Germany.
  - Glad to meet you... Whoever you are :)
